# Second Brain - Study Notes Repository

## Description

Welcome to my Second Brain repository! Here, you'll find a collection of notes I've compiled while studying various topics. This repository serves as my digital knowledge base, capturing insights, summaries, and key learnings from my learning journey.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is: 

1. **Personal Knowledge Management**: By organizing and documenting my study notes, I create a searchable repository of knowledge that I can refer back to anytime. This helps reinforce my learning and aids in retaining information over the long term.

2. **Sharing Knowledge**: While primarily for personal use, I also believe in the value of sharing knowledge with others. Feel free to explore the notes in this repository, and if you find them helpful, I encourage you to use them for your own learning journey.
